			<Label class="p small center">* Android selects the closest matching category, which might also be higher then the device DPI. iOS willl only fall back to lower categories.</Label>
			<Label class="p small center">** The image has no width or height set. On iOS its width in dp will be the width of the matched image in px devided by the LDF of that image. This means it will always show in the expected size. On Android it will be the width of the matched image in px devided by LDF of the device. Only if the device DPI exactly match a category will it show at the expected size. This why you should ALWAYS set the image width or height. Tap the image to set/unset the width to see the difference.</Label>
